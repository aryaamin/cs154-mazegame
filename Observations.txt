I have created 3 subclasses of Shape that is MyCircle, MyLine, MyRectange.

Here Myline is used to create the walls of the maze, circle to create the player, and rectangle to create the final checkpoint that is the final destination.

In the class Shape I have declred 4 new functions which are
refreshr,refreshl,refreshu and refreshd so the refreshr fucntion activates when the right key is pressed on the keyboard and thus the ball moves right and so on for other 3 functions also.

In the 4 refresh functions I have mentioned an if statement that is the value of x and y coordinate gets equal to that of the wall's than the ball should not move to that point this restricts the movement of the ball through the walls and the borders.

Next if the balls reaches the green spot then the command line prints WON and the game exits by exit(0) function.

I have divided the 450*450 window into 9*9 blocks of 50 length and this points are then used to create all the walls.

The ball is controlled by the keyboard so it can move in any direction in the 2D plane with moving 5 length per keypress.
